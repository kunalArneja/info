## Overview
Worked on time in transit ML models to improve the estimated delivery date accuracies.
## EDA
Data cleanup, feature extraction.
## Feature Engineering
using data types, domain knowledge, etc. to derive new features.
## Model Development
Testing different Models - Developing and testing different Models such as XgBoost, LightGBM, RandomForest, AutoML, CatBoost. As well as hyperparameter tuning of various models.
## MLOPs
Built and deployed a complete end to end pipeline with ML Client Nodes, ML Serving Nodes, Monitoring Dashboards, Feature Store, etc. 
## Monitoring
Build Dashboards to check model performance in dark as well as live mode. Comparing training-test skew, etc.
